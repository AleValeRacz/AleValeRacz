## ✨Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet!✨
I'm Ale, a second year computer science student at  Babes-Bolyai University (UBB), and I will serve as your guide. 📍<br>
While i have many interests, computer science shines the brightest, since i've always been a math-oriented, problem solver kind of person. <br>
I'm still learning, exploring, and figuring things out, but I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. Who knows where they might lead me?<br>
Feel free to poke around and explore my projects! 🎀<br>

Ps: In case you're wondering, the kitten's name is Lulu and she's just as adorable now, as a grown cat, as she was in that picture. 🐈
