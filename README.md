## ✨Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet!✨
I'm Ale, a second year computer science student at  Babes-Bolyai University (UBB), and I will serve as your guide. 📍
While i have many interests, computer science shines the brightest, since i've always been a math-oriented, problem solver kind of person.
I'm still learning, exploring, and figuring things out, but I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. Who knows where they might lead me?
Feel free to poke around and explore my projects! 🎀
